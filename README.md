# BankingInTheCloud-Tutorials
This repo provides tutorials for the BankingInTheCloud workshop. 

## Project Setup

The master-branch contains the basic project setup. It contains a Rest-controller that returns the IP address of the server (first device interface).

The basic project setup is based on the demo-project one can generate using the [SpringBoot Initializr](). We used the following settings:

* Generate a ```Gradle Project``` with ```Java``` and Spring Boot ```1.5.4```
